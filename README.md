# Perspective Chat With Friends

## Global Game Jam project, 2014

GGJ page: http://globalgamejam.org/2014/games/perspective-chat-friends

A typical chat program, except everyone in chat sees the conversation differently. Will you be the one that misses an important detail that everyone else noticed? Instructions on how to play: Go to the site. Enter the nick you wish to use and click the button to start. (Note, it doesn't check for duplicate nicks currently) Chat as usual. If you wish to guess someone's restriction, click their name in the chat window. A window will pop up and you can guess. Likewise, if someone is guessing yours, a popup will appear - click OK to confirm, or cancel to say they were incorrect.
